### Gilad lab meeting bingo! ###

* Set up and use
* Game rules!
* Credits

### Set up and use ###

* Clone the repo to your computer.
* The word list is in `bingo_words_y.txt`. You can edit it at will. Multi-word strings should be in quotes, with line breaks explicitly declared with \n. 
* Change the first line in `bingo.R` to point to the repo directory. 
* You can adjust the number of cards produced by playing with the loop. 
* Currently, the central square contains the word "FDR". If you wish to change this, edit lines 14 and 15.
* Run the script in R, and you'll get 9 cards. 


### Game rules! ###

These are the rules by which we play in the lab. You can adjust them at will, obviously.

1. The first rule of lab meeting bingo is that we don't talk about lab meeting bingo. 
2. You cannot ask leading questions the answer to which is something
in your bingo card.
3. You can, however, try to steer the conversation towards the topic
4a. Words count when anyone says them
4b. EXTRA HARD SPECIAL MODE: Words only count when the boss says them
5. If you get a bingo, it's on you to let everyone else know...
without Yoav figuring it out.
6. If you win, you get nothing. :)

In the game's long storied history, there has only been one victor so far, so don't worry about that last rule.

### Credits ###

* The word list was a collaborative effort from members of the Gilad lab past and present.
* The bingo card code was written by Irene Gallego Romero.
